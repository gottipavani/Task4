Description my project : In the modern digital era, recommendation systems play a crucial role in personalizing user experiences on platforms such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, and social media. By analyzing user behavior, preferences, and patterns, these systems suggest items that are most likely to interest the user. 
This project implements an AI-based Recommendation System using Java and Apache Mahout, a popular machine learning library designed for scalable recommendation engines.

The goal of this project is to build a simple yet functional recommendation engine that can predict and suggest items to users based on their past preferences. 
Both User-Based Collaborative Filtering and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering approaches have been implemented to provide a comprehensive understanding of how recommendation systems work.

Project Overview : 
The system uses a dataset stored in a CSV file (data.csv), containing three columns: user ID, item ID, and preference value (rating). 
Apache Mahout processes this dataset to compute similarities between users or items, and then generates recommendations.The project is divided into two main parts:

1)User-Based Recommendation System :
Identifies users who have similar preferences.Recommends items to a user based on what similar users liked.
Example: If User A and User B both like Item 101, and User B also likes Item 103, then Item 103 is recommended to User A.

2)Item-Based Recommendation System : Focuses on similarities between items.Recommends items to a user based on the similarity between items they have already rated.
Example: If Item 101 and Item 103 are often rated together by many users, then a user who liked Item 101 will be recommended Item 103.
Recommends items to a user based on the similarity between items they have already rated.
